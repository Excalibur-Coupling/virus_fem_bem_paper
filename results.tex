\subsection*{\sffamily \large Performance for a molecular geometry}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use arginine 
    \item Compare computer time and iterations for FEM-BEM with standard and hybrid approaches, without preconditioner. 
    \item Show performance of hybrid and standard methods with preconditioner.
    \item Show scaling for larger molecules for hybrid and standard (or the best-performing one)

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Validation for a spherical cavity}

Compare solvation energy results of hybrid and standard FEM-BEM with APBS

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Convergence and performance for a molecular geometry}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mesh refinement study using hybrid and standard FEM-BEM and APBS on arginine or small protein. Check if they are converging to same result.
    \item Compare timings for equivalent error
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Performance analysis for larger structures}

For a given mesh refinement, show solvation energy and timings using preconditioned hybrid FEM-BEM up to the biggest problem we can do on whatever computer we're using.
